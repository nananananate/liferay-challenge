# Liferay Challenge
This is my solution to the Sales Taxes Problem.

My solution is a Java CLI application. 

## Quick Start

Using your terminal, clone the repository and navigate into it. (Alternative: navigate to the files that have been sent via email).

```
git clone https://github.com/nananananate/liferay-challenge
cd liferay-challenge
```

To run the CLI app (a `.jar` file), use these commands:

Windows:

```
java -jar .\out\artifacts\challenge_jar\challenge.jar
```

Linux/macOS:

```
java -jar out/artifacts/challenge_jar/challenge.jar
```


You should now see this:

```
To add an item, type: <amount> <item name> at <price>
Example: 1 imported health pills at 24.45
Enter item (leave blank to proceed to Checkout):
```

You can now enter items and get your receipt! Happy shopping!
